# RepPortal React

This folder contains a simple React-based rewrite of the Blazor **RepPortal** project. It uses Bootstrap for styling and Syncfusion React components for rich UI elements.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The commands above require internet access to download NPM packages. If your environment restricts outbound network access, you will need to set up an offline npm mirror or pre-populate `node_modules`.

## Features

- Responsive layout with a navigation bar and footer
- `TopCustomers` dashboard with Syncfusion charts
- `OpenOrders` grid built with Syncfusion grids

This is only a small subset of the original features, but the structure is ready for additional pages.
